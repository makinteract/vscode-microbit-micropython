Contributing to uFlash
======================

Hey! Many thanks for wanting to improve uFlash.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
age, gender, religion, race or sexuality. If you're thinking, "but they don't
mean me", then we especially mean YOU. Good quality code and engagement with
respect, humour and intelligence wins every time.

* If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most geeky groups, get involved - *we want to help you make a difference*.
* If you're from a background which *is* well-represented in most geeky groups, get involved - *we want your help making a difference*.
* If you're worried about not being technical enough, get involved - *your fresh perspective will be invaluable*.
* If you think you're an imposter, get involved.
* If your day job isn't code, get involved.
* This isn't a group of experts, just people. Get involved!
* We are interested in educational, social and technical problems. If you are too, get involved.
* This is a new community. *No-one knows what they are doing*, so, get involved.
